<h3>Where Did Our Moon Come From?</h3>
<p>The best theory that scientists have came up with on how our one and only moon formed and came to be started long ago. About 4.5 Billion years ago it is estimated that a large "Mars sized object" collided with the earth liquifiing the surface of each celestial body. A large chunk of molten rock was sent into space and a few thousand years later gravity pulled a large clump of the depris and formed our moon. The rest of the particles and larger rock chunks fell back to the earth or got absorbed into this new body of rock called our Moon.</p>

<h3>Why Does The Near Side Look So Much Different Than The Far Side</h3>
<p>If you take a picture of the near side and the far side of the moon and put them next to eachother they look completly different. On the side that faces us there are huge dark spots called seas but on the far side barley any, why is this? Its because of one major event that scientists belive happened about 3.8 Billion years ago. Its thought that due to the near side having such a thin crust compared to the far side, when a series of large astroids smashed into the moon it filled certain areas of the moon with lava and heavy volcanic activity creating these seas of lava. As time passed these pools of lava harded creating the seas we know and lable today.</p>

<h3>History of The Moon</h3>
<p>The history of The Moon dates back to paragraph 1 going back to about 4.5 Billion years where scientists state The Moon was formed. Around 3.8 Billion years ago after the moon was titaly locked the near side, the side that faces us was hit heavily by a swarm of asteroids as explained in paragraph 2 causing the seas of molten lava. 1 Billion years ago all the lava cools and the moon becomes a baren wasteland of solid rock. Then fastforward to the present moon we see in our night sky to this day, going through phases in its montly cycle.</p>

<h3>Fun facts and information</h3>
<p>Some quick and fun facts about the moon are that it drifts away from us ever so slightly at 3.8 cm every year. Due to this in an estimated 500 million years, total solar eclipses will not be possible as the moon will be to far away to fully block out the sun. Because the moon is so large and close to us, it has some effects on earth. The moon causes a bulge near the equators of water, we call them tides and its because of the moon that they happen. And lastly some craters near the poles never ever recieve sunlight, they are constantly dark and the temperatures stay at -400Â°F</p>
